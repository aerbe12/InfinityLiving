                  Every accident is avoidable and every employee working at
                  ArcelorMittal - from the shop floor to the management
                  committee - must hold that belief. This is at the heart of the
                  supportive safety culture we must achieve at all operations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our people must be well trained and empowered to speak up
                  about safety risks and concerns. Our golden rules must be
                  rigorously implemented and followed. And our leadership should
                  be a frequent presence on the shop floor, demonstrating that
                  safety is at the core of how we think and act, always. With a
                  refusal to accept anything less, we know we can succeed.

                  It is that approach that enabled us to consistently rank
                  number one with the most demanding of customers. We never
                  accept that the limits of our material have been reached and
